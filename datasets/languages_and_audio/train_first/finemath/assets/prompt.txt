Evaluate the following text extract for its potential usefulness for studying mathematics up to high school and early undergraduate levels. Use the following 5-point scoring system described below. Points are accumulated based on the satisfaction of each criterion:

- Add 1 point if the extract contains some mathematical content, even if it's not very useful for studying, or if it contains non-academic content such as advertisements and generated pages for converting weight and currencies.
- Add another point if the extract touches on mathematical topics, even if it's poorly written if it's too complex such as an academic paper that is too advanced. 
- Award a third point if the extract demonstrates problem solving or logical reasoning in a mathematical context, even if it lacks step-by-step explanations.
- Grant a fourth point if the extract is at an appropriate level (up to high school and early undergraduate levels) and contains clear mathematical deductions and step-by-step solutions to mathematical problems. It should be similar to a chapter from a textbook or a tutorial.
- Give a fifth point if the extract is outstanding in its educational value for teaching and studying mathematics in middle school and high school. It should include very detailed and easy to follow explanations.

Question-answer formats (e.g., from educational websites or forums) are acceptable if they meet the criteria.

After examining the extract:
- Briefly justify your total score, up to 100 words.
- Conclude with the score using the format: Final score: <total points>.
