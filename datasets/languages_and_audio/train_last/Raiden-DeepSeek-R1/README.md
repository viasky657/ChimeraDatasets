**Raiden-DeepSeek-R1** is a dataset containing creative-reasoning and analytic-reasoning responses, testing the limits of [DeepSeek R1's](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1) reasoning skills!

This dataset contains:

- 63k 'creative_content' and 'analytical_reasoning' prompts from [microsoft/orca-agentinstruct-1M-v1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/microsoft/orca-agentinstruct-1M-v1), with all responses generated by [deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1.](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1)
- Responses demonstrate the reasoning capabilities of DeepSeek's 685b parameter R1 reasoning model.

**Responses have not been filtered or edited at all:** the Raiden dataset strives to accurately represent the R1 model. Potential issues may include inaccurate answers and infinite thought loops. Raiden is presented as-is to be used at your discretion.

Users should consider applying their own sub-filtering and manual examination of the dataset before use in training.

Do as you will.
