# openo1-sft-ultra-35m-data

## Instruction
We have released the openo1-sft-ultra-35m-data, which contains 35 million data points. It is based on existing open-source datasets and synthesized using the openo1-qwen-sft model. We first collected open-source datasets and then annotated the data based on difficulty, quality, and question types using the qwen-2.5-72b-instruct model. To ensure the difficulty and quality of the data, we only retained data where both the difficulty and quality are â‰¥8.
